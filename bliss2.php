                            <br></br>
                            Choosing food industry software for ERP involves selecting the right software and supplier to work with long term. Finding the right food industry ERP vendor is a serious matter: ERP will touch every part of your business.
                            <br></br>
                            It is important to bear in mind that ERP software was originally developed for very large companies. These massive ERP systems can't be transplanted to small and medium sized operations. This why specialist know how is required.
                            <br></br>
                            You will find a better solution for your food ERP software needs if you specify your business processes before you start speaking to suppliers. 
                            You will also need to decide which aspects of your business will be included in ERP implementation. A good consultant, like Drive Computing, can help you weigh up the pros and cons.
                            <br></br>
                            An off-the-shelf or a bespoke software solution? What food and drink ERP software options are available? Detailing your processes will help you refine your options. You could save money by bringing your processes in line with an off the shelf solution. The easier alternative is to chose a flexible solution like BLISS. Having built in flexibility reduces the likelihood you'll need expensive enhancements.
                            <br></br>
                            The key question is: will your investment in ERP food industry software be protected? High ROI can never be guaranteed but in capital intensive sectors such as food and drink, the best software will keep plant utilisation high, inventories and waste low.
